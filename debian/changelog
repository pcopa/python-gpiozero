gpiozero (1.1.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Documentation converted to reST and expanded to include generic classes
    and several more recipes (#80, #82, #101, #119, #135, #168)
  * New "LEDBarGraph" class (many thanks to Martin O'Hanlon!) (#126, #176)
  * New "Pin" implementation abstracts out the concept of a GPIO pin paving
    the way for alternate library support and IO extenders in future (#141)
  * New "LEDBoard.blink" method which works properly even when background is
    set to "False" (#94, #161)
  * New "RGBLED.blink" method which implements (rudimentary) color fading
    too! (#135, #174)
  * New "initial_value" attribute on "OutputDevice" ensures consistent
    behaviour on construction (#118)
  * New "active_high" attribute on "PWMOutputDevice" and "RGBLED" allows use
    of common anode devices (#143, #154)
  * Loads of new ADC chips supported (many thanks to GitHub user pcopa!)
    (#150)
